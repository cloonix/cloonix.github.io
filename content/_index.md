## About this Blog

This blog was created out of pure curiosity. My old Wordpress installation was outdated and so was the content. Since I was interested in Jekyll and Hugo, I started to create this blog based on Hugo and Github Pages.

I am a technical consultant specialising in IT infrastructure, backup solutions and software development. You can find out more under [Imprint]({{< ref "/aboutme" >}})
