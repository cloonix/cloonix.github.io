I'm the kind of person who cares a lot about a good looking theme for his blog before even starting to create content. 

In my first days in a new blog life with Hugo, i was looking into a few simple themes. And simple is Hugo all about, isn't it? My first theme was [Bear Cub](https://clente.github.io/hugo-bearcub/). Nice and simple, but it was missing something special. I found [bacardi55 's Theme](https://git.sr.ht/~bacardi55/MinIndie) and loved it a lot.  

I added this theme as a git submodule. In found that to be the easiest way to work with themes.
