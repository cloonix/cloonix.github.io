title: The fear of writing on my own blog
type: blog
---

I have always loved technical blogs. There is something admirable about people who possess the creativity, discipline, and knowledge to regularly publish content. Looking at my RSS feed, I often envy the writers who seem to effortlessly share their wisdom with the world.

For a long time, this admiration actually stopped me from writing. I would look at others who seemed to have such fascinating hobbies and side projects, while I felt like I was barely keeping up with my regular life. However, I’ve recently come to a realization: I have been drastically underestimating the value of what I do.

## The Comparison Trap

It is easy to fall into the trap of thinking that your daily work isn't "blog-worthy." I spend a lot of time—both at work and during my leisure time—creating solutions and solving problems. Yet, once I am done, I often think it isn't worth writing about. But then, why the hell am I getting paid for it? 😂

That mindset ignores the value of practical experience. While I was busy worrying that my work wasn't interesting enough, I was solving real problems. Realizing that I might be underestimating my own output could be the first step toward changing my perspective. My "regular life" involves overcoming technical hurdles that others are likely facing right now.

## My Resolution for next year: Just Write

With that in mind, my primary intention for the upcoming year is simple: **write more.**

To make this sustainable, I am setting a few ground rules for myself to keep the imposter syndrome at bay:

* **Keep it concise:** I don't need to write a manifesto. Short, interesting posts are often more valuable than long ones.
* **Follow the excitement:** If I am excited about a specific technology or a clever fix, it is almost a guarantee that someone else will find it exciting, too.
* **Sharing is caring:** The tech community is based on shared knowledge. Contributing to that pool is a positive act, regardless of the scale.
* **The "One Person" Rule:** There is always someone out there who hasn't encountered that specific solution yet. If my post helps just one person save an hour of debugging, it was worth writing.
* **Lower the stakes:** You don't have to write to win a Nobel Prize. It’s a blog post, not a thesis.

## But... What About AI?

Looking back over the past two years, I find myself asking an obvious question:

> *Why should I bother writing if an AI can generate a similar output in seconds?*

AI artifacts, while impressive, are usually not creative. They are excellent at summarizing existing knowledge or writing code, but they rarely invent or integrate new solutions. They do not offer new perspectives based on human experience.

AI can tell you how a library *should* work according to the documentation; a human blogger tells you how it *actually* works. That human element — the creativity of the solution and the context of the struggle — is something an algorithm cannot replicate.

At least, I hope this remains true for the foreseeable future.

## Conclusion

If you have been holding back your thoughts because you feel your work isn't "interesting" enough, I hope you’ll join me in this resolution. We don't need to be geniuses or have infinite free time to contribute. We just need to share what we know.

Here is to a year of writing more, worrying less, and valuing our own experiences.
