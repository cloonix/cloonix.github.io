A year ago i bought Keychron K8 Pro (ISO/DE). At that point I had zero experience with keychron or with QMK [[1](https://qmk.fm/)]. QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware is an open-source firmware for keyboards. It allows users to customize keymaps, macros, and various keyboard functionalities to suit their needs. QMK supports a wide range of keyboards and provides powerful features for advanced users.
