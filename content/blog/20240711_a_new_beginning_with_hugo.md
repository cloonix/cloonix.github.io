> Hugo is a fast and flexible static site generator (SSG) written in Go. It's designed for building websites quickly and efficiently, transforming content written in Markdown or other formats into static HTML files. Hugo supports themes, templates, and content organization for a wide range of website types, from blogs to documentation sites. Its speed and ease of use make it a popular choice for developers and content creators looking to deploy websites without the overhead of dynamic content management systems. [1]

Static Site Generators (SSGs) offer several benefits: Speed, security, scalability, version control, cost effective operating, simplicity, flexibility, SEO benefits and offline capabilities in terms of writing articles and posts offline.
