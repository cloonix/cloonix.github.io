I'm trying to improve my vim skills every day, but I'm still not faster than using a regular editor in combination with my mouse. I really like the browser extension [vimium](https://vimium.github.io/) which is available for Chromium and Firefox.  

The principle is simple. You press the "f" key, for example, and the open web page displays a selection of key combinations that (would) open the corresponding link. Then you type (for example) "ad" to open the underlying link.

vimium offers some other shortcuts similar to vim. For example, you can switch between open tabs, close windows or scroll the current page.  

With this addon it is possible to use your web browser without any mouse or trackpad and it is fast too! (And easy to learn).
